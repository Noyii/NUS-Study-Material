    "\n",

    "    - Convert all values of `planning_area` to lowercase to make the naming consistent.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, since the model we are creating is a regression model based on resale values and prices, `planning_area` column does not add much value to our model creation task. Moreover, since we saw before that there is a clear mapping from `subzone` to `planning_area`, we can term `planning_area` to be a redundant column and safely remove the column `planning_area` entirely without loss of any important data for model building.\n",

    "    - `area_sqft` has values ranging from `1` to `8956` sq ft with 50% values above ~`950 sqft` and a standard deviation of `574 sq ft`. This is a very diverse range and skews the data distribution due to outliers, i.e., very low or very high values. \n",

    "    - Remove records that have area_sqft of less than `500 sqft` since 25% of the data is above 667 sqft and the standard deviation is 574 sqft. This will reduce the variance of the resulting area_sqft column, thereby removing noisy points. \n",

    "### 1 (d) Handling Categorical Attributes (4 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many to most data mining algorithms require all input features / attributes to be numerical. Our dataset with transactions resales of condo flats contains attributes that are not all numerical. As such, assuming we indeed want to utilize them, we need to convert those attributes into numerical ones. Regarding encoding techniques, we covered [One-Hot Encoding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) in the lecture. For variables with too many categories (e.g. >30) to be suitable for one-hot encoding, a common alternative is [Target Encoding](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/targetencoder.html), which replaces each category with a numeric value (roughly, the average value of the target variable for that particular category).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common choices for how to handle a categorical attribute include\n",
    "* **Drop**: to drop a variable if it is not likely to be useful for modelling\n",
    "* **Ordinal**: treat it as an ordinal variable\n",
    "* **One-Hot Encoding**: encode each of its categories into a binary attribute\n",
    "* **Target Encoding**: encoder the entire variable into a single numerical attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each of the 4 above choices, select *1* variable that you believe is suitable to be handled using that choice, and justify.**\n",

    "- **Drop**: `eco_category` can be dropped since it has only one distinct value for all records and therefore does not add any additional insight to invidual records.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Ordinal**: `floor_level` has 15 distinct values that are in the form of a range (e.g., `16 to 20`). Floors can be treated as ordinal data as they are always ranked in some natural order or hierarchy, for e.g., Floors `01 to 05` are always below Floors `06 to 10`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding**: `type` has 6 distinct values and thus can be represented using a 1-hot encoded vector since the vector size would be small. Also, there is not prior knowledge as to say a condominium having more preference over an apartment. Hence, all values can be represented with equal weightage, i.e., 1 in the vector. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Target Encoding**: `subzone` has 191 distinct values. Hence, there are too many values suitable for 1-hot encoding and can be replaced with corresponding target encoding. Moreover, since in target encoding, features are replaced with a blend of posterior probability of the target given particular categorical value and the prior probability of the target over all the training data, we might get some added insight about the relationship between resale values and the subzones the flats are in.\n",

    "In Section 1 we focused on addressing any \"obvious\" noise a given dataset may contain. Obvious noise is not well defined, but in general it's this kind of noise that can be identified by simple analysis (e.g., looking at the domains of attributes, or simple statistics such as the distribution/histogram). However, some noise is more difficult to detect. Some outliers can only be identified as such when looking at the combination of different data points. Looking at individual attributes / features does not suffice here.\n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier refers to some record (i.e., data samples) that is very different compared to most other records. Next we see how we can utilize DBSCAN for this task. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm with an explicit notion of noise points, i.e., data points that are dissimilar to data points that form clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Assume you have a $d$-dimensional dataset `X` in the Euclidean space, i.e., each data point as $d$ numerical features (with each feature value in the interval $[0, 1]$). After running DBSCAN over `X`, you get some clustering (again, we only assume it's not only noise). Now you create a new dataset `X_new` by multiplying all data points by 10 afterwards adding 100 to all data points (in Python, assuming X is a NumPy array this can simply be done by `X_new = X * 10 + 100`). Now you can run DBSCAN over `X_new`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explain how you have to change the parameters of DBSCAN for `X_new` to produce equivalent output to the original results on `X`!**. You can ignore any nondeterminism (e.g. border points being assigned to different clusters, as discussed in lecture), or duplicates.\n",

    "**Dataset.** We use a popular movie ratings dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). This dataset contains user ratings for movies (1-5 stars, incl. half stars, e.g., 3.5). Specifically, we use the [MovieLens 1M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) containing 1 Million ratings from ~6,000 users on ~4,000 movies and was released February 2003 -- so do not expect any recent Marvel movies :).\n",

    "While there are more sophisticated recommendation algorithms -- and we will look into those in a later lecture -- here we focus on Association Rules. We convert this rating dataset into a transaction dataset, where a transaction represents all the movies a user has purchased. We already did this for you making the following assumption: A User has purchased all the movies s/he gave the highest rating. For example, if User A gave a highest rating of 4.5 to any movie, A has purchased all movies A rated with 4.5. This is certainly a simplifying assumption, but perfectly fine for this task here.\n",

We need this dictionary since our transactions (i.e., the list of movies a user has bought) contains the ids and not the names of the movies. So to actually see the names of movies in the association rules, we need this way to map from a movie's id to its name."

    "### 4 (c) Sketch a Movie Recommendation Algorithm Based on ARM (4 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we only looked at individual rules and how the set of rules changes for different parameter values for `min_support` and `min_confidence`. However, we still need some method like `make_recommendation(shopping_history)` that takes the shopping history of a user and returns 1 or more recommendations. You do *not* have to implement or provide code for such a method; just briefly sketch any reasonable way to do it, taking into account how to handle situations involving new users (empty shopping history); or users with long shopping history (more than the length of the left side of all our association rules).\n",

    "Assume we give minimum N=2 recommendations to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Case 1: When the user has no shopping history, we just provide any recommendation from all the available titles. This would mean we pick any 2 random movies from the entire list and return to the user. This will enable them to start populating their shopping history, thereby helping in providing them with better recommendations in the future. This is called Cold Start Issue in Recommendation Systems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Case 2: When the user has an extremely long shopping history, we apply ARM and increase both the min_support and min_confidence to a very high value (e.g., min_support=0.8, min_confidence=0.8) and return the top N values. This will enable lesser candidate generation thereby reducing the computation time since there would be a lot of frequent itemsets otherwise. Additionally, recommendations would have very high confidence making them extremely refined/customized to the user (high-quality recommendations). Since the shopping history is huge, we can assume that having a high min_support would not lead to empty itemset generation that easily for unary rules. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Case 3: For cases where users have a moderate shopping history, we use ARM and apply the (Explore + Exploit) methodology where we lower the min_support to enable exploration of diverse movie titles, and increase the min_confidence to refine the recommendations to the user's usual taste. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Thus, in this way, all users would have at least N recommendations at all times, whih would only get better with increased shopping history.\n",
