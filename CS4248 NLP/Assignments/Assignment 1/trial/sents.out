To/NNS the/FW extent/FW they/FW did/FW ,/FW their/FW concern/FW was/FW to/FW ensure/FW fiscal/FW accountability/FW ./.

It/NNS would/FW contradict/FW that/FW objective/FW if/FW the/FW appropriations/FW clause/FW (/FW technically/FW a/FW limitation/FW on/FW legislative/FW power/FW )/FW could/FW be/FW read/FW as/FW placing/FW the/FW president/FW on/FW Congress/FW 's/FW short/FW leash/FW ,/FW making/FW the/FW executive/FW consist/FW of/FW the/FW president/FW and/FW every/FW member/FW of/FW Congress/FW ./.

During/NNS the/FW coming/FW weeks/FW ,/FW President/FW Bush/FW must/FW decide/FW whether/FW to/FW veto/FW the/FW bills/FW containing/FW them/FW --/FW or/FW ,/FW alternatively/FW ,/FW to/FW sign/FW these/FW bills/FW into/FW law/FW with/FW a/FW statement/FW declaring/FW their/FW intrusions/FW on/FW executive/FW power/FW to/FW be/FW in/FW violation/FW of/FW Article/FW II/FW ,/FW and/FW thus/FW void/FW and/FW severable/FW ./.
The/NNS 1990/FW appropriations/FW legislation/FW attempts/FW to/FW strip/FW the/FW president/FW of/FW his/FW powers/FW to/FW make/FW certain/FW appointments/FW as/FW provided/FW by/FW Article/FW II/FW ./.

Thus/NNS ,/FW with/FW one/FW brief/FW passage/FW in/FW an/FW appropriations/FW bill/FW ,/FW Congress/FW repeals/FW the/FW president/FW 's/FW power/FW to/FW make/FW recess/FW appointments/FW under/FW Article/FW II/FW ./.
Section/NNS 605/FW also/FW imposes/FW unconstitutional/FW conditions/FW on/FW the/FW president/FW 's/FW ability/FW to/FW nominate/FW candidates/FW of/FW his/FW choosing/FW ./.
The/NNS language/FW of/FW the/FW appropriations/FW rider/FW implies/FW that/FW any/FW nomination/FW to/FW any/FW position/FW of/FW a/FW rejected/FW nominee/FW will/FW result/FW in/FW the/FW president/FW being/FW denied/FW funding/FW to/FW pay/FW that/FW person/FW 's/FW salary/FW ./.
The/NNS president/FW could/FW probably/FW not/FW avoid/FW this/FW restriction/FW by/FW choosing/FW people/FW willing/FW to/FW serve/FW without/FW pay/FW ,/FW because/FW the/FW Anti-Deficiency/FW Act/FW prohibits/FW voluntary/FW service/FW to/FW the/FW government/FW ./.
The/NNS 1990/FW appropriations/FW bills/FW also/FW contain/FW a/FW number/FW of/FW ``/FW muzzling/FW ''/FW provisions/FW that/FW violate/FW the/FW recommendation/FW clause/FW in/FW Article/FW II/FW of/FW the/FW Constitution/FW ./.

Such/NNS laws/FW violate/FW the/FW provision/FW in/FW Article/FW II/FW that/FW requires/FW the/FW president/FW to/FW make/FW recommendations/FW to/FW Congress/FW ,/FW but/FW which/FW gives/FW the/FW president/FW the/FW discretion/FW to/FW select/FW the/FW subject/FW matter/FW of/FW those/FW recommendations/FW ./.

Perhaps/NNS none/FW of/FW the/FW unconstitutional/FW conditions/FW contained/FW in/FW the/FW appropriations/FW bills/FW for/FW fiscal/FW 1990/FW better/FW illustrates/FW Congress/FW 's/FW attempt/FW to/FW usurp/FW executive/FW power/FW than/FW Section/FW 609/FW of/FW the/FW executive-office/FW bill/FW :/FW ``/FW None/FW of/FW the/FW funds/FW made/FW available/FW pursuant/FW to/FW the/FW provisions/FW of/FW this/FW Act/FW shall/FW be/FW used/FW to/FW implement/FW ,/FW administer/FW ,/FW or/FW enforce/FW any/FW regulation/FW which/FW has/FW been/FW disapproved/FW pursuant/FW to/FW a/FW resolution/FW of/FW disapproval/FW duly/FW adopted/FW in/FW accordance/FW with/FW the/FW applicable/FW law/FW of/FW the/FW United/FW States/FW ./.
